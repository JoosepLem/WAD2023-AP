                    Tartu, Estonia's second-largest city with a population of 97,435 as of 2023, is known for its historical significance. It sits on the Emajõgi river, linking Lake Võrtsjärv and Lake Peipus. Tartu is renowned as the "intellectual capital" due to its University of Tartu, established in 1632. It's also home to the Supreme Court, Ministry of Education and Research, Estonian National Museum, and Vanemuine, the oldest Estonian-language theatre. Tartu is set to become the European Capital of Culture in 2024.

                <p>This course will introduce students to key concepts and technologies for developing modern web applications. The course starts by presenting basic Web technologies and languages (e.g. HTTP, HTML, CSS, Javascript) followed by modern frontend (e.g., Vue.js) and backend development frameworks (e.g., Node.js). Finally, various software testing techniques will be discussed and we will learn how some of them can be used in the context of web applications.</p>

                    JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
